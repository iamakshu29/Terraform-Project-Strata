# Strata Terraform Infrastructure — Status & What's Left

**Project Goal:** Production-grade multi-tier AWS infrastructure across 3 AZs (ap-south-1) using Terraform.

**Current Spec Target:** Align with the comprehensive AWS spec provided (VPC, ALB+ECS+ASG, RDS Aurora, ElastiCache, observability, IAM, KMS, Secrets Manager).

---

## ✅ COMPLETED (Phase 1 — Networking & Core Infra)

### Networking
- ✅ VPC (`10.0.0.0/16`)
- ✅ Internet Gateway
- ✅ Public Subnets (3 AZs: `10.0.1/2/3.0/24`)
- ✅ Private Subnets (3 AZs: `10.0.11/15/19.0/22`)
- ✅ Data Subnets (3 AZs, but only 2 currently used for RDS: `10.0.101/102/103.0/24`)
- ✅ NAT Gateways (2 only, in ap-south-1a and ap-south-1b)
- ✅ Elastic IPs for NAT GWs
- ✅ Public Route Tables + IGW routes
- ✅ Private Route Tables + NAT routes (with `az_to_nat` map handling the 3rd AZ routing through ap-south-1b NAT)
- ✅ Data Route Tables (no outbound internet route)
- ✅ Route Table Associations (all 3 tiers)
- ✅ NACLs (public, private, data) with dynamic ingress/egress blocks

### Security Groups
- ✅ SG for ALB (port 443 from `0.0.0.0/0`)
- ✅ SG for EC2 (port 8080 from ALB SG)
- ✅ SG for RDS (port 5432 from EC2 and ECS SGs)
- ✅ SG for Bastion (port 22, currently open)
- ✅ SG for ECS (port 8080 from ALB SG) — *declared but not yet used*
- ✅ SG for Redis (port 6379 from EC2 and ECS SGs) — *declared but not yet used*
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Bastion SG allows `0.0.0.0/0:22` — needs to be restricted to your IP

### KMS & Encryption
- ✅ KMS CMK for general encryption (RDS, S3, EBS)
- ✅ KMS Alias

### Secrets Manager
- ✅ Secrets storage (RDS username + password)
- ✅ Secret version
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Remove `aws_secretsmanager_secret_policy` if same-account access only

### IAM (Partial)
- ✅ IAM Policy: `read_secrets_policy` (GetSecretValue on Secrets Manager)
- ✅ IAM Roles declared:
  - `role_ec2_instance` — for EC2
  - `role_ecs_task` — for ECS tasks
  - `role_vpc_flow_log` — for VPC Flow Logs
- ✅ IAM Policy Attachments (policies attached to roles)
- ✅ IAM Instance Profile (for EC2 to assume role)
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Complex policy structure in `iam_role_and_policy.tf` needs verification; locals map might not work as expected

### Database Layer
- ✅ DB Subnet Group (across data subnets)
- ✅ RDS PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ, `db.t3.medium`)
  - ✅ Encrypted with KMS CMK
  - ✅ Credentials from Secrets Manager (not hardcoded)
  - ✅ 7-day backup retention
  - ✅ `deletion_protection = true`
  - ✅ `skip_final_snapshot = false` (will require manual intervention on destroy)

### Compute Layer (Partial)
- ✅ ALB
  - ✅ Public subnets across 3 AZs
  - ✅ Deletion protection enabled
  - ⚠️ **Missing:** HTTPS listener (port 443), HTTP→HTTPS redirect, ACM certificate, WAF v2 attachment, access logs to S3
- ✅ ALB Target Group (port 80 HTTP)
  - ⚠️ **Missing:** Health check config, stickiness settings

- ✅ ASG + Launch Template
  - ✅ Latest Ubuntu 22.04 AMI (via data source, no hardcoded ID)
  - ✅ Across private subnets (3 AZs)
  - ✅ Mixed instance policy (on-demand + spot capable)
  - ✅ EBS encryption with KMS
  - ✅ IAM instance profile attached
  - ✅ Attached to ALB target group
  - ⚠️ **Missing:** 
    - Target tracking scaling policy (should scale on ALBRequestCountPerTarget)
    - Lifecycle hook for graceful connection draining on termination
    - SSM agent bootstrap in user data (no SSH keypair should be needed)

- ⚠️ **Bastion Host (EC2 in public subnet)**
  - ✅ Deployed in public subnet (ap-south-1a)
  - ✅ Associated public IP
  - ✅ Attached EBS volume
  - ⚠️ **Issue:** SSH key pair attached; should either restrict SG to your IP or remove SSH entirely (use SSM)

- ⚠️ **App Server (EC2 in private subnet)**
  - ⚠️ **Missing:** Not yet deployed separately; ASG handles this role
  - ⚠️ **Would need:** Restrict SSH to Bastion SG only (not directly from internet)

### Storage Layer
- ✅ Main S3 bucket
  - ✅ Versioning enabled
  - ✅ Public access blocked (all 4 settings)
  - ✅ KMS encryption
  - ✅ Lifecycle rules (IA after 30 days, Glacier after 90)
  
- ✅ Logging S3 bucket (for ALB/CloudTrail logs)
  - ⚠️ Versioning enabled
  - ⚠️ Public access blocked
  - ⚠️ Bucket policy allowing CloudWatch Logs to write
  - ⚠️ S3 logging configured (destination for access logs)

### Observability
- ✅ CloudWatch Log Group (`strata-cloudwatch-log-group`)
  - ✅ 30-day retention
  
- ✅ VPC Flow Logs
  - ✅ Enabled on VPC
  - ✅ Published to CloudWatch Logs
  - ✅ All traffic (`traffic_type = ALL`)
  
- ⚠️ **Missing:**
  - CloudWatch Metric Alarms (ALB 5XX, ECS CPU, RDS connections, Redis memory)
  - CloudWatch Dashboard (as JSON templatefile)
  - Container Insights on ECS cluster
  - X-Ray tracing setup
  - CloudTrail (account-level API audit)

### SSM Parameter Store
- ✅ Parameters created for:
  - DB endpoint
  - S3 bucket name
  - ALB DNS name
  - ⚠️ **Missing:** Redis endpoint (commented out)

## ❌ NOT STARTED (Critical Gaps)

### ECS Fargate — COMPLETELY MISSING
**Spec requirement:** ECS cluster with Fargate tasks, running alongside ASG/EC2

- ❌ ECS Cluster resource
- ❌ ECS Task Definition (with container JSON template)
- ❌ ECS Service (with 100/200 deployment healthy/max percent)
- ❌ ECS Service Discovery (AWS Cloud Map for internal DNS)
- ❌ ECR Repository (with image scanning + lifecycle policy)
- ❌ IAM role for ECS task execution (ecsTaskExecutionRole)
- ❌ Logs sent to CloudWatch

### ElastiCache Redis — COMPLETELY MISSING
**Spec requirement:** Redis cluster (multi-AZ, no cluster mode for now)

- ❌ ElastiCache Subnet Group
- ❌ Redis Cluster
- ❌ Auth token (stored in Secrets Manager)
- ❌ KMS encryption at-rest
- ❌ In-transit encryption
- ❌ Parameter store endpoint

### ACM Certificate — MISSING
**Spec requirement:** HTTPS listener on ALB (port 443)

- ❌ ACM Certificate
- ❌ ALB HTTPS listener (port 443)
- ❌ ALB HTTP→HTTPS redirect listener (port 80)
- ❌ ALB access logs to S3

### WAF v2 — MISSING
**Spec requirement:** Web ACL attached to ALB

- ❌ WAF v2 IP Set (if custom rules needed)
- ❌ WAF v2 Web ACL
- ❌ WAF v2 Association to ALB

### CloudTrail — MISSING
**Spec requirement:** Account-level API audit trail

- ❌ CloudTrail
- ❌ CloudTrail logging to S3 with integrity validation

### Advanced IAM — PARTIALLY MISSING
**Spec requirement:** Granular role separation

- ✅ Basic roles created but needs cleanup
- ❌ Dedicated KMS key admin role (separate from key usage role)
- ❌ `ecsTaskExecutionRole` for ECS
- ❌ GitHub Actions OIDC role (for CI/CD)
- ❌ Secrets Manager rotation lambda role
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Current IAM policy structure is complex; needs verification that policies are correctly attached

### Advanced RDS — PARTIALLY MISSING
**Spec requirement:** Aurora PostgreSQL Cluster (not single instance)

- ❌ Convert from `aws_db_instance` to `aws_rds_cluster` + `aws_rds_cluster_instance`
- ❌ Custom RDS parameter group (with `log_min_duration_statement = 1000` for slow query logging)
- ❌ RDS automated backups with lifecycle rules
- ❌ Secrets Manager rotation lambda for RDS password

### Advanced S3 & Data Layer
- ⚠️ ALB access logs not being written to S3 (ALB listener missing)
- ❌ S3 access logging on main bucket (currently only has logging bucket for ALB)
- ❌ S3 replication (if multi-region planned later)

### Observability & Monitoring — CRITICAL GAPS
- ❌ CloudWatch Metric Alarms:
  - ALB 5XX error rate > 1%
  - ECS CPU > 80%
  - RDS connections > 80% of max
  - Redis memory > 75%
- ❌ CloudWatch Dashboard (as `templatefile()` JSON)
- ❌ Container Insights on ECS cluster
- ❌ X-Ray tracing (X-Ray daemon sidecar in ECS task)
- ❌ Custom metrics / application instrumentation setup

### Multi-Environment Structure — MISSING
**Phase 2 requirement:** Directory layout for dev/staging/prod

- ❌ `dev/`, `staging/`, `prod/` folders with separate `.tfvars` and state
- ❌ Root module refactoring to support multi-env

### Modularization — MISSING
**Phase 3 requirement:** Extract into child modules

- ❌ `modules/vpc/`, `modules/compute/`, `modules/data/`, `modules/iam/`, etc.
- ❌ Root module calling all child modules
- ❌ Module outputs wired to SSM Parameter Store

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & GOTCHAS

### 1. **Bastion Host SSH too permissive**
   - **Current:** `cidr_ipv4 = "0.0.0.0/0"` on port 22
   - **Should be:** Your IP only, or remove SSH entirely and use SSM Session Manager
   - **File:** `security_group.tf`, variable `security_group.bastion.ingress.ssh`

### 2. **IAM Policy Structure Complexity**
   - **Current:** `iam_role_and_policy.tf` uses complex `locals` maps and dynamic policy generation
   - **Risk:** Policies may not attach correctly; verify with `terraform plan`
   - **Fix:** Simplify or test thoroughly before applying

### 3. **RDS `skip_final_snapshot` enforcement**
   - **Current:** `skip_final_snapshot = false` and `deletion_protection = true`
   - **Impact:** `terraform destroy` will fail; you must manually disable both and re-apply before destroy
   - **Intended behavior:** Prevents accidental data loss in prod

### 4. **NAT Gateway redundancy is intentional**
   - **Current:** Only 2 NAT GWs (ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b); ap-south-1c routes through ap-south-1b
   - **Cost optimization:** Real AWS pattern to reduce NAT costs; subnet route tables handle it via `az_to_nat` local
   - **Risk:** If ap-south-1b NAT fails, ap-south-1c instances also lose internet; consider upgrading to 3 NATs in prod

### 5. **ASG missing scaling policies**
   - **Current:** Desired capacity fixed at 2; no target tracking
   - **Missing:** Scale on `ALBRequestCountPerTarget` metric
   - **Impact:** Won't auto-scale with traffic

### 6. **Launch Template uses deprecated `instance_type` in ASG**
   - **Current:** Single `instance_type` in launch template
   - **Missing:** `mixed_instances_policy` in ASG for on-demand + spot instances
   - **Check:** Verify asg.tf actually implements mixed instances

### 7. **Secrets Manager policy is unnecessary**
   - **Current:** `aws_secretsmanager_secret_policy` may be defined
   - **Fix:** Remove if same-account access only (role permissions alone are enough)

### 8. **Test.tf is scratch work**
   - **Status:** Contains experimental locals; should be cleaned up before Phase 2

---

## 📋 PRIORITY BUILD ORDER (Recommended)

### Immediate (fixes & validation)
1. **Verify & Fix IAM Policy Attachment** — ensure `role_ec2_instance` and `role_ecs_task` have correct policies attached
2. **Fix Bastion SG** — restrict SSH to your IP or remove key pair
3. **Remove unnecessary Secrets Manager policy** — clean up if same-account only
4. **Clean up test.tf** — delete experimental code

### Phase 1B (complete the flat tier)
5. **Add ASG Scaling Policy** — target tracking on `ALBRequestCountPerTarget`
6. **Add ASG Lifecycle Hook** — graceful connection draining on termination
7. **Add ALB HTTPS Listener** — provision ACM cert, add port 443 listener, HTTP→HTTPS redirect
8. **Add ALB Access Logs** — enable ALB to log to S3 logging bucket
9. **Create WAF v2 Web ACL** — attach to ALB
10. **Deploy CloudWatch Alarms** — 5 key metrics (ALB 5XX, ECS CPU, RDS connections, Redis memory, custom app metric)

### Phase 1C (complete observability)
11. **Create CloudWatch Dashboard** — as `templatefile()` JSON
12. **Deploy CloudTrail** — account-level API audit
13. **Enable Container Insights** — on ECS cluster (once cluster exists)
14. **Setup X-Ray Tracing** — ECS task sidecar + instrumentation

### Phase 2 (data layer completion)
15. **Deploy ElastiCache Redis** — multi-AZ, KMS encryption, auth token in Secrets Manager
16. **Convert RDS to Aurora Cluster** — `aws_rds_cluster` + `aws_rds_cluster_instance`
17. **Setup RDS custom parameter group** — slow query logging
18. **Setup RDS password rotation** — Secrets Manager lambda

### Phase 2B (application compute)
19. **Deploy ECS Cluster** — with Container Insights enabled
20. **Deploy ECS Task Definition** — template container JSON, CloudWatch logs
21. **Deploy ECS Service** — with ALB target group registration, 100/200 deployment strategy
22. **Deploy ECR Repository** — image scanning, lifecycle policy (keep last 10)
23. **Deploy ECS Service Discovery** — AWS Cloud Map internal DNS

### Phase 3 (multi-environment & modularization)
24. **Refactor to multi-env structure** — `dev/`, `staging/`, `prod/` with separate `.tfvars` and state
25. **Extract modules** — VPC, compute, data, IAM into separate module folders
26. **Refactor root module** — call child modules, wire outputs to SSM

## 🔍 FILES TO REVIEW & CLEAN UP

1. **iam_role_and_policy.tf** — Complex policy structure; verify it works or simplify
2. **asg.tf** — Add scaling policy and lifecycle hook
3. **alb.tf** — Add HTTPS listener, access logs, WAF
4. **test.tf** — Delete (scratch work)
5. **s3_logging_bucket.tf** — Verify ALB access logs are wired once ALB listener exists
6. **cloudwatch.tf** — Add alarms and dashboard
7. **ssm_parameter_store.tf** — Add Redis endpoint once ElastiCache is built

---

## ✨ Next Steps

1. **Run `terraform plan` to identify any errors** in current code
2. **Fix and validate Phase 1** (especially IAM, ASG, Bastion SG)
3. **Build Phase 1B** (ALB listeners, WAF, alarms)
4. **Then tackle Phase 2** (ElastiCache, Aurora, ECS)
